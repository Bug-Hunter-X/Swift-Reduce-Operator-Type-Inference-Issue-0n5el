# Swift Reduce Operator Type Inference Issue

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `reduce` function in Swift, specifically related to type inference.  The `bug.swift` file showcases the erroneous code that leads to a potential runtime error. `bugSolution.swift` provides the corrected solution.

**Problem:**
The `reduce` function requires an initial value. If the type of this initial value isn't explicitly stated, Swift might not infer the correct type leading to unexpected behavior or compilation errors. In this case, Swift might not immediately realize that the `numbers` array contains integers and thus the reduction operation should result in an integer. 

**Solution:**
The solution is to specify the type of the initial value explicitly in the `reduce` function. This ensures that the compiler understands the type of the operation being performed and avoids ambiguity.

**Alternative:**
Alternatively, Swift provides other methods that may be more readable depending on the specifics of the operation being carried out.
